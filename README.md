# Communication Dashboard

The **Communication Dashboard** is a web-based application designed to streamline communication and data visualization. It integrates functionalities like an AI chatbot, message volume analytics, and referral management, all within a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

### 1. AI Doctor Chatbot
- **Interactive Chat**: Users can interact with an AI-powered chatbot for information and assistance.
- **Backend Integration**: Sends user queries to a Flask-based backend for processing and retrieves responses.

### 2. Metrics Dashboard
- **Visualizations**: Displays message volume over time using an interactive Plotly chart.
- **Data Integration**: Pulls data from the backend API (`/metrics`) to ensure real-time updates.

### 3. Referral Management
- **Submission Form**: Users can submit patient referrals with details such as name, date of birth, hospital number, and reason for referral.
- **Tracking**: Displays a list of submitted referrals with status and submission date.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **UI Framework**: Materialize CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly.js
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios
- **Backend**: Assumes Flask API endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- A running Flask backend providing endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd communication-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend API Requirements

The app requires the following endpoints:
- `GET /metrics`: Returns an array of objects with `Date` and `Message Volume` properties.
- `POST /ask`: Accepts a JSON object `{ message: "user query" }` and returns a JSON response `{ reply: "AI response" }`.

## Usage

1. **AI Doctor Chatbot**:
   - Navigate to the *AI Doctor* tab.
   - Enter your query in the input field and press **Send** to interact with the AI.

## Known Issues

- Ensure the backend server is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- Materialize CSS components require proper initialization; issues may arise if `M.AutoInit()` fails.

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication and authorization.
- Support for dynamic backend URLs.
- Implement advanced analytics and filtering for metrics.
